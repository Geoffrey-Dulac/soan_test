# PAYMENT MODULE

For a company, i had to realize this test, which took me a bit less than 2 days.

I used the frameword Middleman (for the build, run : "middleman build"), and i deployed on Heroku.

## Code Organization
### Views

There are two pages : Index.html.erb ("home page") and login.html.erb ("login page"). And 2 partials : Footer.html.erb and Modal.html.erb (Modal for validation payment).

### Styles

As mush as possible, i used bootstrap classes. And when it was not possible, i created specific classes, working as utilities. To make sure to reuse it instead of make duplicates.
For the modal and tabs, i used bootstrap to earn a bit of time.

### Javascript

I use to code in Javascrip (and whithout POO) for a few days/weeks only, so i'am not happy yet of my code Js organization. I tried to keep a quite clear "main function" which call other scripts. And that's why i would say this is not that catastrophic cause i reused few functions and i didn't write duplicate code.
