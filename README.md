# PAYMENT MODULE

For a company, i had to realize this test, which took me a bit less than 2 days.

## Code Organization
### Views

There are two pages : Index.html.erb ("home page") and login.html.erb ("login page"). And 2 partials : Footer.html.erb and Modal.html.erb (Modal for validation payment).

### Styles

As mush as possible, i used bootstrap classes. And when it was not possible, i created specific classes, working as utilities. To make sure to reuse it instead of make duplicates.
